the original shapes program was an exploration of how computers drew shapes, and mathmatical ways to do that.
I quickly became inspired with complex numbers and argand diagramd and started working on adding fractals to 
the program. this is an attempt to re-create the program but in C++, and I intend to add more to it. Shapes 
is a program for exploring geometry and maths. my plan is to start with drawing lines using bresenhams 
algorithm, before working my way onto squares, circles, then multisided shapes. before adding fractals. and 
then looking for new geometries to implement, such as non-euclidian (hyperbolic and spherrical). I also 
intend to introduce some 3D visualisations and perhaps even renders.
